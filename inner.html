		<h1 style="text-align: left; color: #c9c9c1">Mercury</h1>
	  
	  <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It's a little bigger than Earth's Moon. It is the closest planet to the Sun, but it's actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter. Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets.</p>
      
		<div class="mercury">

		</div>
		
        <p>It has a solid surface that is covered with craters like our Moon. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn't have any moons. Mercury likes to keep things simple. Mercury spins slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time. Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation. But a year on Mercury goes fast. Because it's the closest planet to the sun, it goes around the Sun in just 88 Earth days.</p>
        
		
	<p>The smallest planet in our solar system has a big presence in our collective imagination. Scores of science fiction writers have been inspired by Mercury, including Isaac Asimov, C. S. Lewis, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, and H. P. Lovecraft. Television and film writers, too, have found the planet an ideal location for storytelling. In the animated television show "Invader Zim," Mercury is turned into a prototype giant spaceship by the extinct Martians. And in the 2007 film "Sunshine," the Icarus II spacecraft goes into orbit around Mercury to rendezvous with the Icarus I.</p>

		<h1 style="text-align: left; color: #c9c9c1">Venus</h1>
	  
	  <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth's closest planetary neighbor. It's one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it's often called Earth's twin because it's similar in size and density. These are not identical twins, however - there are radical differences between the two worlds.</p>

	    	<img src="images/venus.gif" width="200" alt=""/> 
		</div>
		
        <p style="margin-bottom: 100px">Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it's perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It's the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) - hot enough to melt lead. The surface is a rusty color and it's peppered with intensely crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it's possible some volcanoes are still active. Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface - more than 90 times that of Earth - similar to the pressure you'd encounter a mile below the ocean on Earth.</p>
