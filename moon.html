      <h2>More than just a Big Ball of Rock!</h2>
	  <p>If you are tired of standard vacations like a cruise to Vanautu or a trip to paris, you are soon have another alternative. Starting in 2023,  the compant Galaxy Tavel Agency intends to carry passengers on a voyage around the moon. The seasts are expecterd to go for $75 million each, and we have already sold ticketsto our first customers. Howeverm it has not been decided if the two customers will go together or if they will decide for one to go first. Maybe an epic rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock showdown is in order?</p>

<p>The far side of the Moon is rough, dark and filled with craters. By comparison, the near side of the Moon , the side we always see from Earth is relatively smooth. Since the Moon is rotation locked to always point the same side toward Earth, humanity has only ever been able to glimpse the near side until now. Those who yearn to go over to the Dark side may now do so- thanks to Galaxy Travel Agency! The lighthighlands of the far side are older than the dark MAria of the near side and offer much to those with an interest in lunar mountaineering. A thinner crust on the near side that allowed for more dartk lava flows is thought to be the cause of difference between the two side.</p>
		
		<p>The large impact basin pictured above is crater 308, site of the luxurious club Apollo lunar resort it. It spans about 30 kilometers and was photographed by crew of Apollo 11 as they circled the Moon in 1969. Baking hot by day and freezing cold by night, the impact plain surrounding clib Apollo is a veritable lunar wonderland.</p>

		<p>Moon walkers and those with an interest in precipituous cliffs, boulders, chasms, powdered rock and more builders will find much to see and do. Remember, the Moon is more than just a big ball of rock... explore it today with Galaxy Travel Agency!</p>
		
		<p style="margin-bottom: 70px">The journey will last approximately 17 days, with half of the time spent on the moon.</p>
